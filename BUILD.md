## continuous integration
[Project CI on Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Overdrivr/telemetry)

## Build
### C compiler
Build and install telemetry and tests
```shell
gradlew installTestDebugExecutable
```

Run tests
```shell
cd ./build/install/test/debug/
test.bat
```

### C++ compiler
Build and install telemetry and tests
```shell
gradlew installTest_cppDebugExecutable
```

Run tests
```shell
cd ./build/install/test_cpp/debug/
test_cpp.bat
```

### Generate test vector
The test vector is a collection of communication frames generated by Telemetry, that
can be used during testing to validate the behavior of a specific platform distribution (Arduino, Mbed, etc)
they are working correctly.

Build and install test vector generator

```shell
gradlew installTestVectorsGeneratorDebug
```

Run it. Generated test file is located in `./build/install/testVectorsGenerator/debug/`
```shell
cd ./build/install/testVectorsGenerator/debug/
testVectorsGenerator.bat
```
